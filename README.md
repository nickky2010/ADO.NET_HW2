Write a WinForms application to memorize English words.
 

The database should consist of one table with the fields: Id, word in English, Russian translation, picture-hint.

In the "Training" mode, English words are randomly selected from the database and displayed on the screen. The user enters the Russian translation. When you click the Confirm button, a check is performed and, if the answer is correct, the word is highlighted in green, and if it is incorrect, the word is highlighted in red.
 
 
If necessary, the user can get a picture-hint when you click on the appropriate button.
After pressing the Next button, a new word appears.
 
 
In edit mode, you can change, delete, add information, undo recent actions.
 
 
When you click the Add Picture button, the user selects the file in the standard dialog box, after which the picture is inserted into the highlighted row of the table.
